## Objectives

This project was developed for the Data Management exam with the goal of evaluating the efficiency of two Database Management Systems (DBMS). The analysis is based on measuring the time taken for the execution of various queries to understand how and why the two DBMS perform better in specific situations.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following modules:

### 1. Time Analysis

The first module focuses on the analysis of query execution time for both database management systems. The results will be presented clearly and visually to facilitate easy interpretation.

### 2. Performance Comparison

This module will highlight the relative performance of the two DBMS in different situations. Cases where one system proves more efficient than the other will be analyzed, providing a detailed overview of the reasons for such differences.

### 3. Query Evaluation

The third module involves evaluating performance using different queries. Some of these will be designed to achieve maximum performance in relational systems, while others will focus on situations optimal for NoSQL systems.
